# Changelog

## 2.10.0

> **⚠️ Terms and conditions updated (TERMS_VERSION 1.1.0)**
>
> The data-usage notice in plugin settings was revised to disclose a new behaviour introduced by online package recommendations (see below). When context-aware recommendations are **disabled**, an online browser may now fetch a public guide catalog from `interactive-learning.grafana.net`. These fetches are limited to public catalog and guide files and don't include user identifiers, dashboard data, or any other contextual information beyond standard HTTP request metadata (IP address, User-Agent). Air-gapped installs and browsers reporting offline status make no such fetches. The terms text in `src/components/AppConfig/terms-content.ts` is now the single source of truth and is mirrored to `docs/sources/terms-and-conditions/_index.md` via `npm run docs:sync-terms`. Existing users will be re-prompted to review and accept the updated terms (#802).

### Added

- **Online package recommendations for OSS recommender-disabled mode**: When the online recommender is off (OSS default) and the browser is online, Pathfinder now surfaces packages from the public CDN catalog alongside bundled guides (#802)
  - New Go backend endpoint proxies the public package index and inlines per-package manifests (bounded concurrency, per-fetch timeouts, single-flight cache refresh)
  - Frontend filters with the existing low-weight URL + platform matchers; entries with unsupported predicates fail closed
  - Auto-disabled when the recommender is enabled, when `navigator.onLine === false`, and sticky-disabled for the page session after the first failed fetch so air-gapped installs never re-probe
  - New `OnlineCdnPackageResolver` registered as the third tier of the composite resolver so milestone / recommends / suggests IDs from CDN learning paths resolve correctly
- **Popout step type and editor popout mode**: New interactive step type and corresponding editor mode that pops the editor out into its own surface (#791)

### Changed

- **Terms and conditions disclosure**: Reworded the "Your control" section of the in-app data-usage notice to accurately disclose the new public CDN catalog fetch and bumped `TERMS_VERSION` to `1.1.0` so existing users re-acknowledge (#802)
- **Public terms and conditions docs page**: Published `docs/sources/terms-and-conditions/_index.md` generated from `terms-content.ts` via `scripts/sync-terms-and-conditions.js`. `npm run docs:sync-terms` regenerates the page and `npm run docs:sync-terms:check` (wired into `npm run check`) prevents the in-app and docs copy from drifting (#802)
- **New starter docs**: Comprehensive refresh of the new-starter onboarding documentation (#794)

### Fixed

- **Nested nav reveal for guided steps**: Guided steps now correctly reveal nested navigation when targeting deeply-nested menu items (#796)
- **My Learning "Continue" for URL-based paths**: Clicking "Continue" on URL-based learning paths now opens the next module instead of re-opening the current one (#744, #798)
- **Double skip buttons in guided blocks**: Await React flush before guided execution to prevent a second skip button from briefly appearing
- **Off-axis section header spinner**: Removed the off-axis spinner that could appear in section headers
- **Sidebar tabs lost after toggle**: Restore sidebar tabs after toggling the sidebar off and back on (#790)
- **Plural resolution copy**: Pluralize item count copy and use a static default for plural resolution to avoid empty strings during initial render

## 2.9.1

### Added

- **Grot guide block type**: New `grot-guide` block type for use in the block editor (#766)

### Changed

- **Selector generator pipeline**: Redesigned the selector generator as a candidate-rank pipeline for more deterministic and explainable selector output (#768)

- Added the real `include` for `AGENTS.md` (#765)

## 2.9.0

### Added

- **Floating panel mode**: Pop guides out of the sidebar into a free-floating, resizable panel that can be repositioned anywhere on screen (#764)

## 2.8.0

### Added

## 2.6.0

### Added

- **Open guide after navigate step**: Navigate steps can now open a guide in the sidebar after SPA navigation completes (#732)
  - New `openGuide` field in block editor for navigate actions (e.g., `bundled:my-guide`)
  - Backward compatible: auto-detects `doc=` param in navigation URLs and dispatches guide opening
  - Uses `auto-launch-tutorial` event pattern with dynamic `findDocPage()` import
- **Kiosk mode available without dev mode**: Kiosk mode now only requires the `enableKioskMode` toggle in plugin settings (#733)

### Fixed

- **Selector picker scoping**: Constrain element picker to the hovered element's domain (#728)
  - Added proximity check to `findNearbyFormControl` — only returns form controls within 100px of clicked element
  - Thread `hoveredElement` from inspector through recorder to selector generator with fallback validation
- **Enhanced selector nested queries**: Use `querySelectorAllEnhanced` for nested queries after `:nth-match()` and in `resolveTrailingSelector` (#730)
  - Fixes `SyntaxError` when `:text()` or `:contains()` appear after `:nth-match()` or chained after `:contains()`
  - Monotonic counter for trailing selector markers prevents collision on recursive re-entry
- **Redundant button selector generation**: Avoid duplicate text matching when parent selector already contains the same `:contains()` or `:text()` clause (#731)
- **Plugin settings data loss on Cloud deployment**: Preserve all plugin settings when saving from any config tab (#734)
  - All config forms now spread `getConfigWithDefaults(jsonData || {})` instead of raw `jsonData`
  - Dev mode toggle now fetches current settings before saving instead of wiping all other fields
  - Fixes kiosk mode and coda settings being cleared after plugin version updates
- **Clear filter pills with @@CLEAR@@**: `@@CLEAR@@` on combobox inputs now removes existing filter pills before filling new values (#727)

- **?doc= deep link improvements** (#724)
  - Derive readable tab titles from URL path instead of showing "content.json"
  - Intercept interactive-learning links inside content and open as sidebar tabs
  - Use `interactive` type for interactive-learning URLs (not `docs-page`)
  - Route interactive guides to `openDocsPage` (with reset button) instead of `openLearningJourney`
  - Always show reset button for interactive guide tabs regardless of progress state
  - Don't redirect away from current page on `?doc=` — stay on the user's dashboard
  - Strip stale doc/page/source params from URL when doc can't be parsed
  - Support `?source=learning-hub` to explicitly open as learning journey
- **Assistant text selection UX**: Change button text to "Ask Assistant", orange text highlight, no-fill purple box, 400ms debounce (#722)
- **Tooltip readability**: High-contrast text in tooltip popouts — white in dark mode, near-black in light mode

## 2.5.0

### Added

- **Selector resilience engine**: Retry-with-wait, prefix matching, domain selectors, and strategy escalation pipeline for more robust interactive tutorials (#716)
  - `resolveWithRetry()` with exponential backoff (200/600/1800ms) replaces single-pass resolution in all action handlers
  - `:text()` exact match for short button labels (< 20 chars) eliminates false positives
  - `data-testid` prefix matching fallback when exact match fails (uniqueness-guarded)
  - `panel:` domain selector prefix resolves Grafana panels by title
  - Unified `resolveSelectorPipeline()` with confidence scoring
- **Selector Health Badge**: Inline quality indicator (green/yellow/red dot, stability score, method, match count) in the block editor form
- **Test Selector Button**: Evaluates selector against live DOM and flash-highlights matched elements with numbered overlays
- **Shift+Click hover capture**: Hold Shift during recording to capture hover steps without clicking through — prevents accidental navigation
- **Alt+Click form capture**: Hold Alt during recording to force-capture any element as a form fill — element is focused for typing, step recorded on blur with typed value
- **On-demand alternative selectors**: "Show alternatives" in block editor computes alternative selectors on-the-fly with stability scores and "Use this" swap buttons
- **Auto-populate requirements**: Recorded steps auto-populate `exists-reftarget` and `navmenu-open` requirements

## 2.4.2

### Added

- **Kiosk mode**: Full-screen overlay presenting interactive guide tiles over Grafana, gated behind dev mode and configured in the Interactive Features tab (#712)
  - Fetches rules JSON from a configurable CDN URL with bundled fallback defaults
  - HTML banner block at the top of the overlay for custom branding (sanitized via DOMPurify)
  - Each tile opens the guide in a new tab via `?doc=` deep link with per-rule target URL
  - Kiosk button in the sidebar header; overlay closes only via close button or Escape key
  - Default banner themed for GrafanaCON 2026 with official stacked logo
- **Comprehensive test ID audit**: Added ~100 new centralized `data-testid` selectors across all component areas and centralized ~20 hardcoded test ID strings into `testIds` constants (#711)
  - New test ID namespaces: `editorPanel`, `learningPaths`, `liveSession`, `prTester`, `urlTester`, `codaTerminal`, `homePage`, `controlGroupPopup`, `feedbackButton`, `helpFooter`, `app`, `enableRecommender`, `kioskMode`

### Fixed

- **Sidebar dock toggle**: Prevent dock button from undocking an already-docked sidebar (#710)

## 2.4.1

### Added

- **Custom guide deep links**: Support `?doc=api:<resourceName>` deep links for custom guides stored as App Platform CRDs (#696, #701)

### Security

- **Navigate handler path validation**: Internal navigation paths are now validated against denied routes (`/logout`, `/profile/password`, `/admin/*`, `/api/*`), closing a carry-forward from ASE25039 that becomes higher-impact under default enablement in Grafana 13 (#702)
  - Role-aware validation: admin users can navigate to admin-only paths since guides legitimately steer admins there and Grafana RBAC enforces server-side access control

## 2.4.0

### Added

- **Alloy scenario VM support**: New `alloy-scenario` VM template for Coda terminal, enabling guide authors to deploy Alloy-based sandbox environments (#688)
  - Animated progress bar during VM provisioning with SSH connection status
  - Quota cleanup with polling to auto-destroy stale VMs before creating new ones
  - Persistent VM options in sessionStorage for auto-reconnect across page refresh
- **Package recommender groundwork** (dormant): Frontend infrastructure for the v1 recommender API including response types, allowlist-based sanitizer, deduplication, and composite package resolver — production endpoint unchanged (#693)

### Changed

- **Agent context centralisation**: Concern-routed PR review and centralised agent context for improved review routing and impact analysis (#699)
- **Documentation maintenance**: Updated Coda, workshop, CLI tools, and interactive requirements docs; indexed `CUSTOM_GUIDES.md` (#690, #691, #692)

### Fixed

- **Coda terminal UX**: Fixed VM replacement messages, error/disconnect retry loop, terminal panel not opening from guide connect blocks, connect button state during provisioning, and disconnect as a proper kill switch (#688)

### Chore

- Deduplicated `useSampleApps`/`useAlloyScenarios` into generic `useCodaOptions` hook (#688)

## 2.3.7

### Fixed

- **Section requirement**: Fixed issue with section requirement checking not evaluating correctly
- **Workshop PeerJS config**: Read PeerJS config from Grafana runtime instead of `PluginPropsContext`, which was always null when rendered via `plugin.addComponent()` outside the provider tree (#687)
  - Made PeerJS TLS toggle explicitly configurable

## 2.3.6

### Added

- **`pathfinder.enabled` feature flag**: Global kill-switch for cloud-wide rollout control, separate from A/B experiments. When disabled, the plugin dismounts and the native Grafana help menu takes over (#685)
- **Workshop ECDSA presenter authentication**: Challenge-response authentication using ECDSA P-256 key pairs to prevent peer ID impersonation on the PeerJS signalling layer (#680)
  - Public key embedded in join code; private key never leaves the presenter's browser
  - Removed legacy unauthenticated join path entirely
  - Follow mode gated behind feature flag pending security review
- **CLI manifest pre-flight checks**: New `--package` and `--tier` flags for the e2e command with tier check, minVersion check, and plugin checks before spawning Playwright (#681)

### Security

- Updated `google.golang.org/grpc` to v1.79.3 (#683)

### Chore

- Updated npm to v11.11.1 (#675)
- Updated grafana/plugin-ci-workflows/ci-cd-workflows action to v6.1.1 (#676)
- Updated magefile/mage-action digest to 96c659d (#684)

## 2.3.5

### Fixed

- **Pathfinder-suggest event buffering**: Early `pathfinder-suggest` events from faster-loading apps were lost because the handler was only registered after async experiment init. Added a synchronous buffer that replays events once the real handler is ready (#679)
- **Auto-opened flag deferral**: Deferred the auto-opened localStorage flag write until the sidebar actually mounts, so the flag is never burned if the sidebar fails to open (#679)

## 2.3.4

_Patch release — version bump only._

## 2.3.3

### Added

- **VM template selection**: Guide authors can now specify a custom VM template and sample app name when provisioning sandbox VMs through the `terminal-connect` block (#672)
  - Backend: new sample-apps endpoint, `CreateVM` accepts config map, `resolveVMForUser` respects template/app when reusing or replacing VMs
  - Frontend: `TerminalConnectBlock` form with VM template selector and dynamic sample-app dropdown
  - Block palette hides Coda block types when Coda terminal is disabled

## 2.3.2

_Patch release — version bump only._

## 2.3.1

### Fixed

  - Block editor support with terminal connect form
  - Guided handler support for terminal connect actions
  - Global interaction blocker integration for terminal steps
- **Block editor inline title editing**: Guide title is now editable inline in the header; guide ID is auto-derived from the title on first commit (slug + random suffix), locked after first set (#662)

### Changed

- **Block editor lifecycle redesign**: Replaced two-button publish flow with a single smart primary action button that follows the guide lifecycle: Save as draft → Update draft → Publish → Update. Context-sensitive menu for Publish shortcut, Unpublish, New guide, and Import (#662)
- **Terminal panel improvements**: Enhanced Coda terminal panel with improved storage and connection handling (#666)

### Fixed

- **Title rendering**: Docs pages now render only one title extracted from the content's first heading; learning path milestones with content JSON use the title from the JSON itself (#663)
- **Request timeouts**: Each content fetch request now uses its own timeout instead of sharing a single timeout across multiple requests, fixing intermittent "signal timed out" errors (#664)
- **Relative URL resolution**: Relative URLs in unstyled.html learning path content (e.g., `/sign-up/`) now resolve against `https://grafana.com` instead of the Grafana instance origin (#665)
- **Block editor race condition**: Fixed backend link lost after page refresh due to undefined sentinel value (#662)
- **Block editor stale closures**: Fixed stale closure bugs causing incorrect toast messages and breaking change detection after unpublish (#662)
- **Empty guide loading**: Fixed empty guide failing to load from library; blocked saving guides with no blocks (#662)

### Fixed

- **Guided popup themes**: Guided popup now correctly respects light/dark mode settings (#656)

### Changed

- **Reduced module size**: Optimized plugin bundle size for improved initial load performance (#659)

### Chore

- Updated grafana/plugin-actions digest to b82357e (#658)

## 2.2.0

### Added

- **Code block type**: New `code-block` block type for interactive guides with syntax highlighting, copy-to-clipboard, and step completion tracking (#650)
  - Block editor support with language selector, filename, and code content fields
  - Action handler for code block interactions in the interactive engine
- **Auto-collapse section toggle**: Added `autoCollapse` option for interactive sections, configurable in both the block editor and app config (#649)

### Fixed

- **Quiz reset**: Fixed quiz block not resetting answers properly when restarting a guide (#649)
- **Admin access**: Fixed interactive features configuration page not loading correctly for admin users (#649)

### Security

- **DOMPurify v3.3.2**: Updated DOMPurify to v3.3.2 to address CVE-2026-0540; iframes with `data:` URLs are now fully removed instead of sandboxed (#651)

## 2.1.1

### Fixed

- MCP `tools/call` responses now correctly wrap results in the `content` array as required by the MCP 2025-03-26 spec, fixing compatibility with Grafana Assistant

## 2.1.0

### Added

- **MCP server**: HTTP Model Context Protocol server at `/api/plugins/grafana-pathfinder-app/resources/mcp`, enabling AI assistants (e.g. Grafana Assistant) to discover and launch Pathfinder guides
  - `list_guides` — returns the bundled guide catalog with id, title, description, category, and type
  - `get_guide` — returns the full content JSON for a specific guide by ID
  - `get_guide_schema` — returns JSON Schema for guide content, manifest, and repository formats
  - `launch_guide` — queues a guide launch for the current user; Pathfinder opens it automatically within 5 seconds if the sidebar is active
  - `validate_guide_json` — validates a guide content.json string and returns structured errors and warnings
  - `create_guide_template` — generates a valid guide skeleton (content.json + manifest.json) ready for editing
- **Frontend polling hook** (`usePendingGuideLaunch`): polls the backend every 5 seconds and opens the Pathfinder sidebar to the requested guide when a pending launch is found
- **`openWithGuide` method** on `GlobalSidebarState`: opens the sidebar and dispatches the guide, handling the case where the sidebar is not yet mounted

## 2.0.7

### Changed

- **Experiment refactor**: Extracted experiment logic into dedicated `experiments/` module with separate orchestrator, utilities, and debug tooling; simplified `module.tsx` by removing inline experiment wiring
- **OpenFeature integration**: Added OpenFeature client wrapper for standardized feature flag evaluation
- **Analytics**: Added RudderStack event support and new suggestion state tracking via `global-state/suggestion.ts`

## 2.0.6

### Fixed

- **Terminal streaming**: Fixed terminal streaming issue in the Coda terminal live hook
- **Publish**: Fixed publish issue with terminal live hook import

## 2.0.5

### Fixed

- **Terminal streaming**: Simplified streaming implementation across backend (`stream.go`, `resources.go`) and frontend (`useTerminalLive` hook), removing redundant code paths

## 2.0.4

### Fixed

- **Session key simplification**: Removed `userLogin` from `sessionsByVM` key, using `vmID` alone. Eliminates identity-mismatch bugs across SDK paths and the reconnect race condition where an old RunStream's teardown could delete a newer session's registration
- **Reconnect race condition**: Fixed race where overlapping RunStream teardown for the same VM could delete the active session from the secondary index, causing 410 errors in Grafana Cloud

## 2.0.3

### Security

- **Terminal input auth**: Removed client-controlled user identity from terminal input; user is now derived exclusively from the SDK's `PluginContext` to prevent session impersonation

### Fixed

- **Session lookup**: Fixed 410 (Gone) errors on every terminal input/resize caused by user identity mismatch between `RunStream` (SDK PluginContext) and `handleTerminalInput` (missing HTTP header)
- **Instance lifecycle**: Moved `streamSessions` and `userVMs` from package-level globals into `App` struct fields so they are properly scoped to plugin instance lifecycle and cleaned on `Dispose()`
- **SSH retry logic**: Auth errors (wrong key, permission denied) no longer waste same-VM retry budget; they break immediately to provision a new VM
- **Context-aware retries**: Replaced `time.Sleep` in SSH retry loops with `select`/`time.After` so context cancellation is respected immediately
- **WebSocket write deadline**: Added 30s write deadline on WebSocket writes to prevent indefinite blocking when the relay stops reading
- **Reconnect timer leak**: Stored reconnect `setTimeout` ID in a ref and clear it on unmount to prevent post-unmount state updates
- **PEM validation**: `normalizePrivateKey` now validates the result with `pem.Decode` and returns an error for malformed keys instead of passing them silently to `ssh.ParsePrivateKey`
- **First poll delay**: `waitForVMActive` now polls immediately before entering the 3-second ticker loop, avoiding unnecessary delay for already-active VMs

### Improved

- **Session lookup performance**: Added secondary `sessionsByVM` index for O(1) terminal input routing instead of O(n) scan under mutex
- **Output throughput**: Added output coalescing goroutine that batches SSH output within a 5ms window (up to 32KB) before sending, reducing per-message gRPC overhead
- **Buffer sizes**: Increased SSH read buffers from 4KB to 32KB and PTY baud rates from 14400 to 38400
- **Console log gating**: Terminal connection logs gated behind dev mode per Grafana best practices; `connectionLog` converted to a per-connection factory to eliminate shared mutable state
- **Error logging**: `sendStreamError` and `sendStreamStatusWithVmId` now log marshal and send errors instead of silently discarding them
- **PublishStream comment**: Corrected misleading comment to clarify it is implemented for SDK compliance but never invoked

## 2.0.2

### Fixed

- **Terminal connection**: Fixed an issue with connection timeout

## 2.0.1

### Fixed

- **Terminal reconnection**: Fixed issues with reconnection and timeouts to VMs (#639)

  - New "Custom guides" section in the context panel shows user-published guides
  - Guide library modal for browsing and loading saved guides
  - Publish workflow for sharing guides within an organization
  - Backend API for guide storage and retrieval
- **Go backend**: Added plugin backend using `grafana-plugin-sdk-go` for streaming, resource handling, and API endpoints (#591)
- **Terminal block type** (experimental): New block type for embedding terminal sessions within guides, requires backend configuration (#591)

- **Package model Phase 0-1**: Initial implementation of the guide packaging model (#623)
- **Maintain-docs skill**: New AI skill for periodic documentation audits and maintenance (#602)

### Changed

  - Added directory-scoped ESLint import boundary rules encoding the tier model
  - Added architectural invariant ratchet tests to prevent regressions
  - Eliminated all barrel bypass violations
  - Moved components to correct architectural tiers
- **Stricter TypeScript**: Enabled `noUncheckedIndexedAccess` for stricter null safety on indexed access (#606)
- **ESLint security rules**: Added `no-restricted-syntax` ESLint rules for security and architecture enforcement (#611)

- Security audit (#590)

## 1.8.0

### Added

- **Home page**: New dedicated home page (`/a/grafana-pathfinder-app`) serving as a centralized learning hub with learning paths, badges, and progress tracking. Accessible via a "My learning" button in the sidebar, with automatic redirect when the recommender is empty (#579)
- **User profile bar**: Replaced the "Recommended learning" header in the context panel with a compact profile bar showing badge progress, guide count, streak info, and a CTA to open the next recommended guide (#585)
- **12 new path-completion badges**: New badges with whimsical names and emoji icons, earned badges appear first in the grid sorted by most recent, with legacy badge indicators for badges earned in previous versions (#579)
- **Deep link page redirect**: Added `page` query parameter to deep links so that after the sidebar launches a guide, the center console navigates to a relevant Grafana page (e.g., `?doc=bundled:first-dashboard&page=/explore`) (#574)

### Changed

- **Renamed "learning journey" to "learning path"**: Updated all UI references from "learning journey" to "learning path" for consistency (#586)
- **Template variable passthrough**: Grafana template variables (`${variable}`) are now preserved and rendered in markdown content instead of being stripped by sanitization (#573)
- **Content fetching improvements**: Now renders `content.json` first if available for all docs, with `null` value handling to avoid fetch errors (#569, #571)

### Fixed

- **Learning path progress**: Fixed completion percentage display and added "Restart" button for completed learning paths with confirmation UI. Improved handling for URL-based paths and milestone auto-completion (#587)
- **Reset progress**: The "Reset progress" button now clears per-guide interactive step completion data, preventing guides from instantly re-completing when reopened (#585)
- **User storage performance**: Introduced envelope-based storage format replacing separate timestamp companion keys, with automatic migration of old-format data. Improves reliability and performance of cross-device syncing (#570)

### Chore

- Updated npm to v11.10.0 (#577)

## 1.7.1

### Fixed

- **Context panel progress stuck at 0%**: Fixed completion percentage display for learning journeys and interactive guides on the context/recommendations panel. Learning journeys now correctly read from `journeyCompletionStorage` (async), and interactive guides now correctly read from `interactiveCompletionStorage` instead of the wrong storage type.

## 1.7.0

### Breaking changes

- **Learning journeys**: The plugin must be updated to this version for all learning journeys to render correctly again due to the migration from unstyled HTML to JSON.

## 1.6.0

### Added

- **Interactive learning journeys**: Learning journeys now support interactive content, allowing guided, hands-on steps within structured learning paths. Expect more learning journeys to become interactive over time.

## 1.5.2

### Fixed

- **Empty `response.url` in content fetcher**: Fixed "Redirect target is not in trusted domain list" errors on Grafana Cloud environments where platform-level fetch interception produces synthetic responses with empty `response.url`; now falls back to the validated original URL (#564)
- **GitHub CDN redirect allowlist**: Expanded `isGitHubRawUrl()` to accept `objects.githubusercontent.com` URLs that GitHub redirects to for blob storage, fixing PR Tester failures in dev mode (#562)

### Changed

- **PR Tester file limit**: Increased maximum content files from 5 to 100 to match GitHub API's default page size, preventing silent truncation of large PRs (#565)
- **PR Tester pagination warning**: Added user-facing warning when a PR may contain more content files than the API returns in a single page (#567)

## 1.5.1

### Fixed

- **Dev-mode selector generation**: Fixed `findNearbyFormControl()` incorrectly selecting unrelated form controls when clicking elements inside buttons or links; added structural scoping for `data-testid` selectors to improve stability (#557)

### Changed

- **Developer documentation refresh**: Updated developer docs to align with current implementation, including feature flag documentation, interactive types, requirements reference, and selector guidance; removed obsolete HTML-era docs (#560)

## 1.5.0
