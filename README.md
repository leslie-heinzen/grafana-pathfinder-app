Get help exactly when and where you need it. Interactive learning brings contextual documentation and interactive guides directly into Grafana, so you can learn and build without leaving your workflow.

## What is Interactive learning?

Interactive learning is your in-app learning companion. It provides:

- **Smart recommendations** – Get relevant docs and guides based on what you're working on
- **Interactive guides** – Follow step-by-step guided learning paths with "Show Me" and "Do It" features
- **Tab-based navigation** – Open multiple docs and guides in tabs, just like a browser
- **Milestone tracking** – See your progress through learning paths with clear milestones
- **Always available** – Access help without switching windows or searching documentation sites

## How to access Interactive learning

1. Look for the **Help** button (?) in the top navigation bar of Grafana
2. Click the Help button to open the Interactive learning panel
3. Browse recommended documentation based on your current context
4. Click **View** to read a doc or **Start** to begin an interactive guides

## Getting started

Once you open Interactive learning:

1. **Review recommendations** – See docs and guides tailored to what you're doing in Grafana
2. **Open content in tabs** – Click "View" or "Start" to open content in a new tab
3. **Navigate guides** – Use the milestone navigation at the bottom to move through learning paths
4. **Try interactive features** – Click "Show Me" to see where things are, or "Do It" to have Interactive learning guide you through actions
5. **Manage your tabs** – Close tabs you're done with, or keep them open for reference

## For administrators

### Discovering Interactive learning

Users can find Interactive learning in multiple ways:

- **Help button** – Click the Help (?) button in the top navigation
- **Command palette** – Search for "Interactive learning", "Need help?", or "Learn Grafana" in the command palette (`Cmd+K` or `Ctrl+K`)

### Configuration options

Admins can configure Interactive learning from the plugin's configuration page in Grafana. The configuration includes three sections:

#### 1. Configuration (basic settings)

- **Auto-launch guide URL** – Set a specific learning path or documentation page to automatically open when Grafana starts (useful for demos and onboarding)
- **Global link interception** – (Experimental) When enabled, clicking documentation links anywhere in Grafana will open them in Interactive learning instead of a new tab

#### 2. Recommendations

- **Context-aware recommendations** – Enable/disable recommendation service that provides personalized documentation based on your current actions in Grafana
- **Data usage controls** – Review what data is collected and toggle the feature on or off

#### 3. Interactive features

- **Auto-completion detection** – (Experimental) Enable automatic step completion when users perform actions themselves (without clicking "Do it" buttons)
- **Timing settings** – Configure timeouts for requirement checks and guided steps to optimize the guide experience

## Creating interactive guides

Editors and admins can author custom interactive guides in two ways:

- **In the block editor inside Grafana** — open the **Editor** tab in the Pathfinder docs panel. No JSON required; the editor handles save, draft, publish, and update for you. See the [Block editor user guide](docs/sources/block-editor/_index.md).
- **By writing JSON directly** — for guides that ship in the plugin bundle or are versioned in git.

### Documentation

- **[JSON Guide Format Reference](docs/developer/interactive-examples/json-guide-format.md)** — Complete reference for the JSON guide structure and all block types (markdown, image, video, section, conditional, interactive, multistep, guided, code-block, terminal, terminal-connect, grot-guide, quiz, input, assistant)
- **[Interactive Types](docs/developer/interactive-examples/interactive-types.md)** — Action types (`highlight`, `button`, `formfill`, `navigate`, `hover`, `noop`, `popout`) and when to use each
- **[Requirements Reference](docs/developer/interactive-examples/requirements-reference.md)** — Available requirements for controlling when interactive elements are accessible
- **[Selectors Reference](docs/developer/interactive-examples/selectors-reference.md)** — How to target DOM elements with the enhanced selector engine and the resilience pipeline

See the [JSON Guide Demo](src/bundled-interactives/json-guide-demo.json) for a complete example of all block types.
